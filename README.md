# MERN stack - User Authentication
Minimal full-stack MERN app with authentication using JWTs and Bcrypt.

## This project uses the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org) and [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for frontend
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the backend
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the database
- [JWT](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#readme) to share security information between client and a server
- [Bcrypt](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js#readme) to turn a simple password into fixed-length characters called a hash
